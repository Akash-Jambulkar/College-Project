# INTERNSHIP-PROJECT

This is my first project for the college internship. I have gained knowledge of Html , Css and Javascripts with a good command in data structures. Its a basic web page which visualizes various sorting methods such as bubble sort, quick sort, heap sort, insertion sort, merge sort. It was a good time playing and enjoying with project.
